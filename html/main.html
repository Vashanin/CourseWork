		<h1> Generations of computers </h1>
		<h3> First generation </h3>
		<span>
			<p> The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory, and were often enormous, taking up entire rooms. They were very expensive to operate and in addition to using a great deal of electricity, the first computers generated a lot of heat, which was often the cause of malfunctions.</p>
			<p> First generation computers relied on machine language, the lowest-level programming language understood by computers, to perform operations, and they could only solve one problem at a time, and it could take days or weeks to set-up a new problem. Input was based on punched cards and paper tape, and output was displayed on printouts.</p>
			<p>	The UNIVAC and ENIAC computers are examples of first-generation computing devices. The UNIVAC was the first commercial computer delivered to a business client, the U.S. Census Bureau in 1951.</p>
			<p>	ENIAC was the world first successful electronic computer which was develops by the two scientists namely J. P. Eckert and J. W. Mauchy. It was the beginning of first generation computer. The full form of ENIAC is "Electronic Numeric Integrated And Calculator" ENIAC was a very huge and big computer and its weight was 30 tones. It could store only limited or small amount of information. Initially in the first generation computer the concept of vacuum tubes was used. A vacuum tube was such an electronic component which had very less work efficiency and so it could not work properly and it required a large cooling system.</p>
		</span>
		<h3> Second generation </h3>	
		<span>
			<p>	Transistors replace vacuum tubes and ushered in the second generation of computers. The transistor was invented in 1947 but did not see widespread use in computers until the late 1950s. The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors.</p>
			<p>	Though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube. Second-generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output.</p>
			<p>	Second-generation computers moved from cryptic binary machine language to symbolic, or assembly, languages, which allowed programmers to specify instructions in words. High-level programming languages were also being developed at this time, such as early versions of COBOL and FORTRAN. These were also the first computers that stored their instructions in their memory, which moved from a magnetic drum to magnetic core technology.</p>
			<p>	The first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry.</p>
		</span>
		<h3> Third generation </h3>

		</span>

		<h3> Fourth generation </h3>
		<span>
			<p>	The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the computer—from the central processing unit and memory to input/output controls—on a single chip.</p>
			<p>	In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh. Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors.</p>
			<p>	As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the Internet. Fourth generation computers also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.</p>

		<h1> Central processing unit </h1>
		<span>
			<p> A central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The term has been used in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry.</p>

			<p> The form, design and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory) and execution of instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.</p>

			<p> Most modern CPUs are microprocessors, meaning they are contained on a single integrated circuit (IC) chip. An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer; such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC). Some computers employ a multi-core processor, which is a single chip containing two or more CPUs called "cores"; in that context, single chips are sometimes referred to as "sockets". Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered central. There also exists the concept of Virtual CPUs which are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources.</p>

		<h1> Memory unit </h1>
		<span>
			<p> RAM stands for Random Access Memory and is a type of chip used in primary storage memory. It is also temporary storage, holding software instructions and short-term working memory for the processor. RAM can be increased in most computers by using the expandable memory slots. </p>

			<h4> Primary storage </h4>
			<p> Primary storage (RAM)is called 'primary' because it is the main memory that is accessible to the CPU. It is used to store data that is currently being used.</p>

			<h4> Random access memory </h4>
			<p> Random access memory or RAM is a form of data storage used in computers. Taken in the form of integrated circuits which represents primary or temporary storage, it allows data which is stored to be accessed in any order, which is why it's called random. Making it random instead of sequential greatly increases the speed the computer can operate since time is not wasted going to the place where needed data is stored (as in tape backups). </p>

			<h4> Volatile </h4>
			<p> Volatile is a descriptive word for RAM which is short term memory; when the computer loses power the temporary storage will be lost . In order to prevent data from being lost, it must be saved to a hard disk or permanent storage area called ROM (Read Only Memory).</p>

			<h4> Fast </h4>
			<p> RAM (in most cases)work faster than a hard drive, and some, faster than flash memory (which isn't volatile). This greater speed is why it's still used in computers today. Computers will run faster and more efficiently with more RAM. The suggested amount of RAM for current operating systems such as Windows Vista/XP and OSX 10.5 to run smoothly with the weight of shared graphics memory and programs is 1024 megabytes (1GB). Currently, RAM comes in 3 types: DDR1, DDR2 and DDR3. DDR1 and 2 are currently most used. DDR3 operates at a higher frequency and has 3 data transfer channels thus increasing bandwidth. Newly developed SSD hard disks currently are capable of meeting and exceeding the transfer rate of DDR and DDR2.</p>

			<p> A 32bit operating system is only capable of utilizing 4gb of RAM. However a 64bit operating system is capable of supporting much more memory.</p>

		<h1> Video cards </h1>
		<span>
			<p> As of 2016, the primary suppliers of the GPUs (video chips or chipsets) used in video cards are AMD and Nvidia. In the third quarter of 2013, AMD had a 35.5% market share while Nvidia had a 64.5% market share,[15] according to Jon Peddie Research. In economics, this industry structure is termed a duopoly. AMD and Nvidia also build and sell video cards, which are termed graphics add-in-board (AIBs) in the industry. (See Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units and Comparison of AMD graphics processing units.) In addition to marketing their own video cards, AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to authorized AIB suppliers, which AMD and Nvidia refer to as "partners".[1] The fact that Nvidia and AMD compete directly with their customer/partners complicates relationships in the industry. The fact that AMD and Intel are direct competitors in the CPU industry is also noteworthy, since AMD-based video cards may be used in computers with Intel CPUs. Intel's move to APUs may weaken AMD, which until now has derived a significant portion of its revenue from graphics components. As of the second quarter of 2013, there were 52 AIB suppliers.[1] These AIB suppliers may market video cards under their own brands, or produce video cards for private label brands or produce video cards for computer manufacturers. Some AIB suppliers such as MSI build both AMD-based and Nvidia-based video cards. Others, such as EVGA, build only Nvidia-based video cards, while XFX, now builds only AMD-based video cards. Several AIB suppliers are also motherboard suppliers. The largest AIB suppliers, based on global retail market share for graphics cards, include Taiwan-based Palit Microsystems, Hong Kong-based PC Partner (which markets AMD-based video cards under its Sapphire brand and Nvidia-based video cards under its Zotac brand), Taiwan-based computer-maker Asustek Computer (Asus), Taiwan-based Micro-Star International (MSI), Taiwan-based Gigabyte Technology,[16] Brea, California, USA-based EVGA (which also sells computer components such as power supplies) and Ontario, California USA-based XFX. (The parent corporation of XFX is based in Hong Kong.) </p>
